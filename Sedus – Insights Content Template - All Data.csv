Hacktivism,Techonology,1,Facts and figures,Hacktivism,,,Body Copy,"Workplaces are built on human capital. They represent the place in which an organization expresses its common interests, purposes and visions. Where solidarity, reciprocity and resource sharing are embodied for the benefit of everybody.

According to Robert Putnam1, two different kinds of social capital exist. The first is the based on the relationships between homogenous groups, such as members of the same family or tribes and it is known as “bonding social capital”. The second is based on the positive interactions between hetereogeneous groups of people, such as ethnic groups or generations and it is known as “bridging social capital”.
In Putnam’s vision, the traditional organization could always rely on its bonding social capital. It was the glue that held the company together, fostering a sense of belonging and establishing shared values. But the forces of globalisation, demographic upheavals and the digital revolution has limited its influence. An increasingly diverse and disparate workforce has shifted the emphasis towards a greater balance between boding and bridging capital. So, a sense of belonging to a team becomes more important to flexible workers and freelancers while the sense of belonging to the organization depends on conecting teams harmoniously.

Research and experience show us that firms are already team based. They form naturally as teams focusing on sales, manufacturing, retail, product development, service and geographically independent divisions. The challenge is how to coordinate and align these teams, encouraging them to share ideas and information, work together and how we adapt to a new structure that is less focused on upward mobility and more on the development of leadership based on positional power2.

Josh Bersin, founder of Bersin by Deloitte, has underlined the importance of developing the ways in which teams work together and how to create well-balanced human capital as the primary goal of organizational design. This is mainly reflected in the capability of an organization to attract and retain the best talent, to allow them to work in the best possible way and to support them with the most engaging work settings, in terms of space, tools and resources.

“The new organization of today requires us to rethink leadership strategy, focus on culture and engagement, deliver on-demand organizational learning, and provide information centers, analytics, and digital HR tools to help people operate, share information, and work together well”3, he said.

An important aspect of the evolution in the way teams work together, is related to the way workers are included in decision making. The important thing is to avoid top-down impositions and offer the freedom to organise work to better match their work-life balance. Companies which do so have created a better working culture and are more able to adapt to new market conditions4. The interest in flatter organizations, which once was restricted to the tech industries, is rapidly spreading to all other sectors. Attracting new talent is still the strongest motivation for companies to invest in dynamic workplaces. Individuals have the choice to decide where, how and for how long they work. The basis on which they make such choices are diverse and no longer limited to attaining the best salary or career path.choice to decide where, how and how long they work and the drivers upon which they choose are very diverse and not only limited to the best salary or carrier path.

Back in 2006 before the last recession, “The Future of Work” research project from The Workplace Intelligence Unit found that there are at least 10 psychological drivers of workforce productivity which are typically more effective than financial rewards. These drivers - meaning, values, optimism, collaboration, confidence, individualism, autonomy, originality, goals and recognition (see table opposite) - represent the various reasons why employees feel satisfied and engaged in a particular company.

The last ten years have taught us that these factors are not permanent. They change over time as an employee’s needs, expectations and desires change. They also change in line with demographic and cultural changes in the workforce.

This is just as true for freelance and flexible workers as it is for permanent staff. Research shows that the vast majority of organizations (83 percent) consider their part time and contracted staff to be just as productive as full time employees5.

Among the drivers identified, those aspects which support a better work life balance and more flexibility have become increasingly important. This is less a gender based issue with both men and women asking for more time to spend with their families.

As life and work become increasingly integrated, the workers are looking to find new and better ways to balance their professional and personal commitments, asking for better working environments, for more freedom of choice and for the possibility of defining their own professional goals. These dynamics are changing the role of engagement. It is no longer a goal in its own right but a means to create a working experience which positively blurs the lines between private and public life as well as those between individuals, the company and the society.

They are seeking an experience in which their personal fulfillment goes hand in hand with the development of a workplace culture that is respectful of differences in characteristics like age, gender and culture, and that sees the employee not only as a person with skills and competences for the service of the company, but also as an agent of change, a person with healthy links to society and the world outside.

In this scenario, the idea of flexibility is not simply about the capability of the workplace to respond to change, but also the way the company embraces and manages the cultural and wider social changes it should adopt to meet the needs of individuals. “Hierarchical organizational models aren’t just being turned upside down — they’re being deconstructed from the inside out”6.

Technology has a great role to play in this change, but companies mainly need a cultural change: they need to include employees in the process of defining and deciding the company’s goals, allowing them to share their day-to-day experience with the management and participating in the creation of a flatter and flatter organization. Employees need to develop new skills, too.

More freedom at work brings responsibilities and opportunities such as the chance to manage time in a better way or collaborate with other team members to achieve shared goals. By developing such skills, employees gain the power to ""hack"" their working lives to following their personal preferences7, to pursue personal goals, propose new ideas or volunteer in social projects.

Increasingly these projects are welcomed by companies because they represent new forms of civic participation or activism that creates a sense of community within employees. In many cases the companies themselves propose cultural or social programs in which everybody is free to participate. “When individuals feel strongly about a company’s performance on social or environmental issue, one small voice can quickly become a swarm, difficult for even the most shielded executive to ignore”, says Jen Boynton8.

Connecting social issues with the business is a visible sign of a company which embraces democratization, takes care of its employees and bravely face new challenges. “Today our social investments focus on providing access to medicines and building health care capacity for those most in need"", said Caroline Roan, president of the Pfizer Foundation""9.

Making the world a better place” and “doing business” are no more seen as a different goals, as well as putting “the interests and priorities of the employees ahead of customers and shareholders” as millennials are largely entering in the workforce and the old fashion CSR mindset is transformed into “active business citizenship”10.

A paradigm shift based on the belief that higher profits and better products and services are generated by the links between business, community and actively engaged employees. A shift that transforms work from something in which employees do their best, to something in which they be their best.

Hacktivism,Techonology,2,The expert‘s talk,Efficiency as result of transparency,,,Bio,"With a degree in Mechanical Engineering, Gianmaurizio Cazzarolli has worked for Tetra Pak since 1982. After a period in the R&D and customer services teams as a manager, today he serves as Director of the Facility and Real Estate Management in the research and production centre of the group in Modena. His team handles all the support operations for the 852 employees, more than 100 of whom come from some 32 countries, in a company that “cares about people, which represent our main investment and our competitive advantage”.",19,,,
Hacktivism,Techonology,2,The expert‘s talk,Efficiency as result of transparency,,,Interview,"Traditionally, efficiency and flexibility are seen as mutually exclusive when managing a workforce; when one increases the other decreases. This does not seem the case with organizations that care about the wellbeing of employees: what are your thoughts about that?

G.C. _ An open organization is one that cares about the welfare of people, offering the necessary flexibility to help them work better and it is often rewarded with a greater willingness from the employee to give more than expected. If a company is transparent and shares with its own employees information and goals, every person is aware of the work process, accepts responsibility and eventually is also available to help colleagues, knowing that next time they will help them back in return.

Therefore, our experience shows that efficiency and flexibility are not exclusive, at all. Empowering people and facilitating their interactions results in the optimization of the working process.

The secret lies in the common sharing of a corporate philosophy, a set of values that everyone must respect. Our mantra is to achieve the goals we have set in a project through the satisfaction and engagement of those who work in it.
Apparently, we are moving from a model of work in which the employees are free to customize their workplace to one in which they have the chance to choose times and places in which to work. Is that the case with Tetra Pak, too? How would this freedom of choice in the way to work impact on the role of management?

G.C. _ Tetra Pak is a family based company, founded in Sweden, a country with a very different working culture compared to those in the Mediterranean. In our offices flexibility has always been at the centre of the relationship between employee and company, at all possible levels.

Allowing flexibility means acknowledging that there are individual aspects - such as who is more efficient in the morning and who in the afternoon - organizational ones - such as those who work with clients in different time zone regions - and work-life balance ones that require a managerial skill to be learned. A skill that we try to teach through dialogue and the development of a particular mindset especially in managers, because it is obvious that if a manager offers greater recognition to someone for staying longer in the office than someone who is more efficient - as often happens in traditional businesses - this would go against the very idea of flexibility. It’s a continuous process that includes opportunities for discussion and support, exchange of experiences and respect for a transparent relationship between the various working levels of the company.

What is the importance of teams in this type of work process? What are the degrees of freedom?

G.C. _ Teams are key elements in the way we work. The employees take responsibility for the work of their own team. Successes and failures are shared and therefore it is in the team that we have to provide the flexibility to assure a good work-life balance.

Tetra Pak has taken the idea of “efficient flexibility” that is typically associated with the new economy and digital sector, and introduced it to a traditional manufacturing industry. What are the peculiarities and difficulties you've encountered in this regard?

G.C. _ First of all, we must specify that the concept of a team in Tetra Pak is not based on departments or functions, but on the set of people who, for various reasons and at different levels, are involved in a project. Therefore it involves people who are working on the project at different stages and in various ways, from the design and construction of machines to the phase of testing of packages or from R&D to commercial.

What are the values that Tetra Pak seeks to develop as the main link between the company and its employees through flexibility at work?

G.C. _ Definitely the main value of this relationship between employees and the company is transparency: there is no real sharing unless you have maximum information flow and knowledge about the challenges and the strategic goals of the company.

Based on that, we can then establish an open dialogue in which everybody can participate and set the modalities through which to achieve our stated goals.

The realisation stage of a project also has to be transparent. In our company the progress of all projects is visible to everybody. We have a so-called ""war room"", a sort of forum at the heart of the production plant, around which all operational areas converge: in this space, some panels report the production chains marked with green, yellow or red depending on whether they're complying with the schedule, they are addressing some problem or they are late.

Simply sharing this information establishes a dialogue between teams, promotes the exchange of experiences and activates forms of collaboration. But transparency is not just about information: all of our offices and facilities are designed for maximum visual transparency and flexibility.

The offices are conceived as smart boxes, made of glass panels, the layout of which can be easily modified in response to specific working requirements. Open space, meeting rooms, separate offices: when we contracted the architects who built our offices, we did not explain to them the way we work. The result was a modular building that allows changes very easily, over a weekend, without modifications to technical plants and still providing maximum transparency among the working spaces.

This is another way to allow people to take responsibility for their behaviours: everyone can see everyone, no hierarchy - of course ensuring confidentiality through the maximum insulation from noise.

Is the company engaged in social projects? How do these projects fit with the company's strategy and how are employees involved? Are they free to combine work and social commitments?

G.C. _ When you ask employees to stay at work overtime or respond to emails outside office hours it means you ask them to combine their professional and private lives. For us, this is acceptable only if allow it to work both ways. Between private interests and work commitments there are a lot of social initiatives that we sometimes promote as a company. We have teams that develop a sense of community amongst employees outside the office, such as those dedicated to artistic or sporting events or charity ones. Many of these projects are related to everyday life. So, we developed a series of public cycle lanes in partnership with the Municipality of Modena to encourage employees to bike to work. Similarly, we contributed to the building of a kindergarten which is open to the children of employees and local citizens. In this way we believe that the collaborative spirit that characterises our way of working can go beyond the gates of our company and become a model for other organizations.",20,,,

Don't Worry Be Healthy,Health & Wellbeing,2,The expert‘s talk,,,,Interview,"Dr Breithecker, statistics show an increasing number of people suf- fering from obesity, whilst offices represent the main environment in which people live a sedentary life. In your opinion, which are the main factors on which we should work to fight this?

D.B. _ Yes indeed, “sitting is killing you!”.
A vast amount of evidence has been published on the links between sedentary behavior and the leading causes of morbidity (cardiovascu- lar disease, diabetes and some cancers) and mortality regardless of any benefits from physical activity in leisure time. One cannot blame it only on the chair. The main risk factor is inactivity. Due to prolonged sitting on rigid chairs, we stop contracting the antigravity muscles. Yet, particular muscular contractions are the secret of success that trigger positive physical-mental-emotional interaction functions.
The fibrous tissues form a major organ system, which communicates with all the organs of the body including the brain. Once muscle fibers begin to move, signaling molecules are constantly released (proteins, enzymes, hormones) that influence the metabolism throughout the body positively. So get workers to stand and/or move more frequently. Our main goal has to be: Less confinement to the desks - integrate movement into your daily routine! Sit a maximun of six (better 4 hours), the rest of the working day you should stand and ambulate.

How much does well-being in the office depend on physical characteristics and quality of the space and how much does it relate to the good interactions among individuals?

D.B. _ Wellbeing, attention, social interaction and mental efficiency are strongly linked to environmental conditions. These keep on stimu- lating us positively or negatively. Millions of sensors on and in our bodies gather any relevant information.
Our sensory system is the ultimate “juggler” for keeping us physically, mentally and emotionally balanced:
Due to our genetic disposition, it reacts to sensory stimulation coming from natural factors. Therefore, more and more health-oriented spatial concepts emphasize daylight, good acoustics and fresh air.
However there is also an important sensory system located in our body, mainly distributed in muscles, which is known as the proprio- ceptive system or deep sensibility and takes is responsible for our body awareness. Numerous studies prove the significance of this sensory system for physical and mental vitality.
Consequently, our deep sensibility needs regular movement to pro- vide to us with physical, mental and social well-being. movement also has an impact on increased mental activity throughout team work- ing: This is why a lot of conference rooms or brainstorming areas have standing desks or allow small groups to talk while walking.

How important is the freedom of choice where to work in the office or the possibility to change posture while working?

D.B. _ Every person is different in nature.
If individual requirements, such as personal working rhythm, are not considered sufficiently in the design of the workplace, important hu- man potential is lost.
Our individual physical and mental well-being is based on complex biological and biomechanical interactions, which can be promoted by flexible workplace concepts.
We need open spaces in and out of an office (non territorial work- ing) where work tasks and spontaneous work positions are in balance. Furthermore, various options for social and collaborative interactions are required.
A variety of physiological postural changes and motions could be the positive consequences of spaces designed and equipped with appro- priate furniture, such as chairs with a three dimensional flexibility, standing solutions and relaxation areas.
Flexible working times for a better balance between work and leisure
– “Work-Life-Blending” – is necessary, as well.

Innovative working spaces are often introduce informal working areas in which seating and desks seem to disregard the basic principles of ergonomics: What is your opinion about this? D.B. _ The times in which we classified postures as dogmatically right and wrong are history. Humans beings are not designed to remain in a static posture for a long time. They are made to make a variety of postural changes and motions in an encouraging physically and socially stimulating environment.
Open workplaces and new flexible working concepts, in particular if fitted with adequate motion-promoting furniture, are, therefore, a good example of how spaces can already influence our sub consciousness, which, in turn, intuitively has effects on our bodies’ behavior. We are able to apply “intelligent” physiological self- organization, allowing them to unconsciously respond to stress signals of the body – as in the motion of a freestanding person.

Wearable devices track employee’s performance, health conditions and status of wellbeing: What are the benefits you see - if any - from the use of these devices? How do you believe they might change our working environments?

D.B. _ Modern information technology is ideal in supporting flexible workplace concepts such as open spaces or non-territorial working particular for so-called “knowledge workers”. Work where and when you want at different locations and in different postural positions - stand, sit, relax, walk- in the office, at home or elsewhere.
Mobile devices also make an important contribution in work-life- blending. In this case people can realize a more individualized and health-promoting rhythm of activity and relaxation, mental tension and recovery.
Mobile devices and their flexible use must go hand in hand with a corporate culture generally supporting processes in which employees will find an adequate environment where they feel comfortable and where they can work productively while maintaining and promoting their health.

Don't Worry Be Healthy,Health & Wellbeing,,Case Study,,,FACEBOOK,Body Copy,"The design team’s objective was to balance the open spaces, where people are encouraged to work and socialize, with the closed ones, where people can find concentration and focus.
Facebook‘s new Campus design is based on the results of recent research on the advantages and disadvantages of the two main models of organizing the working space: Open space and closed offices.
The result is a new kind of open space, the largest in the world, designed for pro- ductivity, well-being and people’s happiness and based on three principles: prox- imity, privacy, permission.

Proximity is the principle that intends to avoid excessively crowded environments, leaving enough space between people, creating aggregation sites and social spac- es, where resources may be shared (services, cafeterias, etc. ).

Privacy is the principle guiding the design of the workplaces, providing them with visual and acoustic privacy, allowing people to have control over the space around them.

Permission is a set of rules of “corporate behavior” that are part of the corporate culture and establish coexistence between people.

These principles include a strong focus on physical movement, which is strongly encouraged. The entire central area of the Campus is fully pedestrianized and equipped with bars, restaurants, open-air areas, etc., where people can work, socialize or simply relax.
The Campus offers numerous playgrounds where people can dedicate time to socializing during sport or just keep in shape. Bicycle parking lots with locker rooms and showers encourage people to go take their bikes or run to work.
People are given the choice of different working environments, and of how and how long they work. In the office, all the desks are adjustable in height in order to balance sitting and standing, and for those wishing to move while working, workstations equipped with treadmills are available.",68,,,

Their partnership is a true testament to cutting-edge strategic and creative symbiosis - whereby they uniquely tailor a strategy and set-up for each project, analysing clients’ objectives and aspirations and evolving them into a creative process to inspire exceptionally innovative design solutions",76,,,
From Space to Place,People & Culture,,The expert‘s talk,THE EVOLUTIVE WAY TO THE EMOTIONAL OFFICE,,,Interview,"In this issue, we want to explore how spaces can be conceived as “enabling platforms”, i.e. tools to welcome and foster new technolo- gies and new collaborative processes. Starting by considering the office space of the building, what is the role of architecture in pro- moting new ways of working? How can we combine the constraints and the rigidity of the building with the need for flexibility and flu- idity of the contemporary working space?

S.C. _ Architecture and building structures are crucial elements in find- ing an optimal starting point for the definition of spaces for new ways of working. This important fact is often not considered sufficiently. Over the last years, we have learnt that a very important point in pro- moting collaboration and communication is to have as few stories as possible. Thus towers, though perfect from a real estate point of view, are not the best models of office space. It is far better to have a large horizontal floor plate, around 2-4.000 square meters, with open spac- es, as few columns as possible and light from both facades, that we can use the way we want. And “the way we want” not only refers to the present, but also to a time 5-10 years from now, in case something dif- ferent arrives in the office and the space will be forced to change. We do not know what and how, but we know we will have to be ready for it and we should make it as easy as possible for a company to adjust and change. In addition, you can also see how floor plates are organ- ized. If you look at the easyCredit project, for example (see the section “The Case”), you will see an almost perfect building because of the way people can move in it: you can always go diagonally, taking the short- est way and this naturally encourages people to quickly see and talk to each other rather than writing emails or make phone calls.
So, yes, we think that the quality of buildings is actually the foundation of an optimal workspace. Research shows that the “open office” model, as opposed to cubi- cles, did not keep its promise of ensuring both an optimal level of productivity and user engagement. It turned out that one always had to be sacrificed for the benefit of the other. What is your opinion about it?

S.C. _ We do not think we can provide a “onefitsall” solution. We need to look at the company needs, vision and goals and understand the individual needs of the employees. Research helps us to discover how to balance the working space providing the flexibility related to the changing needs of concentration, collaboration and all the areas in between. Different companies promote different types of working, so it is clear that we cannot only provide one solution. We need to compose multiple configurations in order to suit the multiplicity of people’s needs. We also think that, if you engage the employees in the process and make sure they have a say in making decisions, this will not only be the first step towards creating the right mix, but a way to empower the employees, foster the engagement and create the bases for amaz- ing teams.
The “evolution model” concept brings an emotional dimension to the office space: how does this element provide value and meaning in the creation of a space designed to engage the employees? How do you evaluate the emotional impact of your projects?

T.R. _We think a sense of “belonging” is one of the fundamental needs of everyone. This is why people do not just look for interesting jobs or for a salary.
The research strongly focuses on belonging to a group of people, to a company and people want to be proud of their workplace and identify with their work.
All these are emotional elements the space can express showing what people are passionate about, creating the identity of the company and representing the values and the vision it shares with the employees. This creates engagement, and research shows that people who are engaged and emotionally connected to the workplace perform much better. They are less ill, they have fewer accidents and make fewer mis- takes. Any company able to engage its employees better will have a huge advantage in today’s global market. Is there a “golden rule” in balancing the need to focus and to col- laborate in the agile office? If so how do you calibrate this rule to the specific needs of each company?

S.C. _ No, we have not found a golden rule yet, to be honest, and every time we discuss the topic of balance between focus and collaboration with our employees get a different result. This is because focus and collaboration - not to mention all the other modalities in between of course - are “the” elements that define the workplace. We come togeth- er in places because we want to work in teams, but, at the same time, we need to find places to focus and think. In order to work and gener- ate new ideas, it takes the right balance between being able to think and reflect and being able to exchange with and inspire others. This is why research is crucial. It helps understand how the company works, how many different types of work it promotes and how to create the right mix: selecting the right ingredients and combining them in the right way, with the right amount and in the right architecture.
In your projects, it is quite common to see everyday objects replac- ing traditional office solutions: boats and cable cars used as seating or meeting rooms, vintage household furniture to characterize more informal spaces. What is the role of industrial office furniture in the social areas of your projects? T.R. _ Indeed, you can find quite unusual objects in many of our pro- jects.
The reason is very simple: we are trying to create identity. And identity is based on symbols and objects that reflect and stand for the company culture, its values and spirit. This, however, is only one side of the coin. We also use these objects to create emotional spaces to promote a cer- tain mind set. When we design a workshop space, we like to think of people feeling relaxed, open and interested in other people’s ideas. Therefore, we create a stage combining functional furniture from of- fice suppliers and emotional components we might find anywhere. However, since people might have to change their working modalities quickly, we always design spaces to facilitate such mindshifts as much as possible.
Only a combination of different solutions, i.e. home furniture, home accessories and office furniture can really help people use the work- space to perform to the best of their ability.",77,,,

The biggest challenge was the change from a traditional workspace with dedicated desks to a completely new activity based style of working. Thus, the building was divided into “Homezones” and “Meet & Create Zones”.
Each “Homebase” consists of a unique mixture of different workplace typologies to cater to the different needs of the employees depending on their daily activities. A share rate of 75% was introduced based on extensive occupancy and work typolo- gy research. As a consequence, extra space was gained for the “Meet & Create Zone”. This area is the driver for creativity and innovation and consists of a large number of diverse informal areas and specially designed spaces for creativity and focus.
The internal functional organization of the building utilizes the idea of a city: a main staff restaurant and a Barista Bar with a vibrant “marketplace” feeling, the “Homezone”, consisting of several “Homebases” creating individual local neigh- bourhoods for the employees to work in, and the inner ring of the building as the “Meet & Create Zone”.",104,,,

Generation Flex,Health & Wellbeing,,The expert‘s talk,HOW TO PROMOTE MULTIGENERATIONAL COLLABORATION,,,Interview,"Offices are becoming multigenerational spaces, where at least 4 generations work together side by side. What are the main aspects you have to take into consideration when creating spaces fostering the collaboration between different generations?
J.T._ There are two aspects that are most relevant:
1.        All generations can be integrated and co-designed.
The workplace should make people feel at home. They should identify themselves with their working environment and feel comfortable being there. For example, after a consultation with our facilities management team and the department involved, we redesigned and fitted out our own offices. We have introduced tables with castors to make them more adaptable, repainted walls to make them more attractive and specified lots of wooden elements and fitted curtains to the windows. This is certainly not something that works for every team, but in this case, it contributes enormously to our identity. These spaces are now very popular, as they are not only used by different generations, but also by the executive team.
2.        Create choices and spaces for different needs.
For customers who take part in our Work Smart coaching, it is essential to create spaces that facilitate communication and encourage people to share information spontaneously. This shortens lines of communication and significantly improves the ability of the organisation to innovate. Collaborative spaces are complemented by quieter areas, so-called silent zones, where people can retreat and focus.

You have created The Future Work Experience Team at Swisscom. Which is the purpose of the team and the role it has in your company?
J.T._ At Swisscom we have identified three action fields: Work Smart as the content of Swisscom; product and service innovation and Work Smart Coaching. In each of these fields we have a pilot and co-pilot. I am personally responsible for the field of Work Smart Coaching.
My role is to establish new ways of working with our customers and anchor them. The main factors in this regard are the workplace itself, technology, management and working culture. At Swisscom, the primary driver of cultural change in 2010 was the introduction of a new communication solution. This involved the removal of fixed line phones, amongst other things. Within Swisscom, we introduced a collaboration platform to help us share knowledge, create transparency and learn from each other. The primary aim of this project was the creation of an ‘Open Book Culture’. The first sign of the success of this was the fact that as well as our own company, we found that clients were also drawn to it. So, we started to offer Smart Work Coaching as a service. So far, our team has helped more than 70 companies in this way. A third outcome was that we began to facilitate the implementation of new technologies to foster communication and collaboration. Insights from the projects then feedback into the organisation and help us to develop new ideas.

Which are the main   challenges   and   opportunities of a multigenerational office? How do you handle the different needs and requirements of these generations in implementing new smart working concepts?
J.T._ At the moment, the situation is that older workers often want to engage with our team. This is partly based on a concern that younger people can do their work instead, so they will lose their jobs. However, we believe each person possesses unique skills in their field of expertise. So, for example, we find that older workers are markedly stronger when it comes to project management, whereas younger people are better with new technologies. We want
to harness these particular strengths, irrespective of a person’s age or background, and build on them. This allows us to match each employee as well as we possibly can with what they’re good at. Rather than focusing on their differences, we encourage employees to recognise and value the strengths of others. In this way, we create an environment based on trust, in which people are confident enough to break down barriers and develop their sense of curiosity.

One of the initiatives you guide is a so-called reverse mentoring. Please, tell us how it works and in which way you involve the different generations in these projects.
J.T._ Young employees are also involved in the coaching process, especially by helping older colleagues to adapt to new technologies. For example, specially produced videos communicate the way digital work can be carried out to other employees.
Cultural aspects are also communicated by the younger generation in a natural and playful way.
Part of the reason we employ specific people in the workplace is to help with the adoption of new technology. They wear red sweaters to make them instantly recognisable to colleagues. One of the interesting things we learned was how open older generations of workers are to work with their younger colleagues to learn about new digital devices.
We encourage younger people to present on new working methodologies and also give them the responsibility to lead projects. For example, the Head of Workspace & Collaboration spent several weeks reverse mentoring with one of our younger colleagues. One was responsible for explaining how Work Smart functions and the other was responsible for explaining the role of a management. They were able to learn from each other and to help each other. What are measures that a company should put in place to assure benefits to all generations? How do they contribute to a multi-generational wellbeing?
J.T._ Social Proof is the key factor. When Work Smart is implemented, it is extremely important that there is management buy-in, which means they promote it and live it too. The integration of different disciplines such as IT, HR, FM and communication plays an important role. Another aspect is empowerment and the transfer of responsibility to everybody including younger employees. For example, we recently witnessed a CEO encourage a young employee to join him in formulating a vision for the company. An openness to change and readiness to redefine the roles of young employees contribute to vertical integration.
This opens up new perspectives and creates an environment that does away with control and instead leads to trust and transparency. The right spaces offer the chance for young and old to come together in conversation and to exchange ideas.
These spaces also create new communities. At Swisscom, we also have a virtual employee who we call 'Smartina', who starts conversations about new working methods and is ready with advice and answers.

Generation Flex,Health & Wellbeing,,Emerging Patterns,Trends,Case Study,THE INTERN,Body Copy,"Today’s and tomorrow’s workforce is expected to work until age 65 or even more. Because of this, it is essential that educators, policymakers and business leaders have a deeper look at the dynamics of a multi- generational workforce, understand its nature and develop supportive management practices.
The Intern is “a comedy that uses humour to demonstrate the value of creating a multi-generational workforce in a world that often glorifies twenty-something billionaires and disregards issues of ageism in the workplace.”
Moreover, the movie highlights the beauty of a variety of work habits that co-exist thanks to a mix of generations: while the “senior” intern brings wisdom, experience and balance into the frenetic workplace of an Internet startup, the movie also celebrates the energy and creativity of the Millennials who are driving today’s tech economy.

Generation Flex,Health & Wellbeing,,Emerging Patterns,Trends,Case Study,ENCORE.ORG,Body Copy,"While many people might think that the contemporary aging society is merely a problem, many others also see it as a solution. Encore.org promotes work in the second half of life, based on the idea of leveraging the skills and talents of experienced adults to improve communities and the world. It combines social impact, purpose, and often, continued income. In other words Encore is a bridge, a channel, a platform for communication, “a movement to tap the skills and experience of those in midlife and beyond.”
In fact Encore does not work with individual job-seekers, nor do they list jobs. What they do is summarised in 3 points:
-        Use different communication techniques and the power of personal stories to “create a new narrative for later life” with the aim of challenging conventional thinking about aging;
-        Create and support pathways to connect people in later life with opportunities for work that benefits society.
-        Serve as a hub and resource for people who share the Encore vision. By embracing this culture it might be possible to improve later life, and also create a better future for generations to come.

Generation Flex,Health & Wellbeing,,Emerging Patterns,Trends,Case Study,PALETTE,Subtitle,Transgenerational art engagement programme,120,,,
Generation Flex,Health & Wellbeing,,Emerging Patterns,Trends,Case Study,PALETTE,Body Copy,"Promoting Art for Life Enrichment Through Transgenerational Engagement (PALETTE) was founded in 2013 and its first programs were launched in 2014. PALETTE connects junior health professionals and active older adults through creative arts activities. In the United States, ageism is a challenging issue, that affects care delivery and long- term health outcomes for older adults. Palette was created in order to challenge those negative attitudes, providing a transgenerational arts programming to foster friendships that can break down generational stereotypes.
A successful intergenerational program is a collaborative experience, with both younger and older generations contributing to the exchange in a meaningful and deliberate manner. Such intergenerational programs can challenge stereotypes and foster new understanding between generations. By structuring its programming around the collaborative creation of art, PALETTE provides a forum for younger and older adults to build relationships in a meaningful and purposeful way.

Generation Flex,Health & Wellbeing,,Emerging Patterns,Trends,Case Study,MOUNT’S ILC,Body Copy,"Our society is getting older and many elderly caring associations are starting to understand that combining different generational needs could be a way to increase social interaction in the community.
The Mount’s Intergenerational Learning Center (ILC) is a community of individuals composed of children, adults in need of short-term rehabilitation care and older members of the community who need a home.
Thanks to the interaction and the connections among these generations, the intergenerational learning center offers educational programs for the youngest as well as caring assistance for the oldest. During the workday, children and Mount’s residents come to the classroom, trying different activities such as music, art and storytelling: all these activities bring positive results and benefits for all generations. For the elderly people, having this degree of social interaction helps them in reducing loneliness and mental decline. The impact on children is not clear yet, but researchers suggest that kids who have early contact with older people are more respectful and less conditioned by the ageism phenomenon. For kids, having this kind social interaction is very important for the development of their own values.

In fact it has been suggested that many young employees might find it difficult to engage to with older people when they are anxious.
This is only one of various possible challenges and potential conflicts that the digital firm wanted to minimise.
In collaboration with Google they created NEXTGEN “a global development programme for all of its employees to help them learn from their peers”. The program aims to train the next generation of digital talent, not only by giving people expertise in a wide range of digital tools but also by improving as much as possible their interpersonal skills, combining interactive live classes and collaborative virtual group projects.

Generation Flex,Health & Wellbeing,,Emerging Patterns,Trends,Case Study,REVERSE MENTORING - MICROSOFT,Body Copy,"In order to cope with both the growing generational gap and the need to stay on the cutting digital edge, more and more senior executives are turning to their younger colleagues for insights and guidance.
At Microsoft Norway, Michael Jacobs, General Manager, regularly meets with Magnus Svorstøl Lie, Partner Sales Executive hired through the Microsoft Academy of College Hires (MACH) program, for one-on-one sessions in flipped mode.
Michael gets coaching on topics ranging from new digital communication tools to workplace trends, while Magnus gets valuable insights into leadership and a glimpse at the larger picture.
It’s called reverse mentoring, initially launched at Microsoft Austria in 2014, has gradually spread over all European countries.
What drives younger talent? How to move forward? What the workplace should look like? These are just some of the questions that can be answered when digital natives coach senior leaders. It is also perceived as a personal challenge in order to learn something different by exploring new ideas and reflecting on leadership and the way it influences the workplace.

Generation Flex,Health & Wellbeing,,Emerging Patterns,Trends,Case Study,GRUPO GALLEGOS,Body Copy,"The offices of Grupo Gallegos at Huntington Beach, California, are designed by Lorcan O’Herlihy Architects and built into the shell of an old movie theater. It offers a great example of the overlapping zones trend.
LOHA worked to give employees a layout that would promote easy and meaningful collaboration. Part of that was achieved by knocking down walls and barriers to give ‘visual connectivity’. Moreover, common areas and crossing points are specifically designed in order to “help encourage spontaneous collaboration among employees”. The stairway, for instance, is a place where you can often find employees sitting down and having informal meetings.
Research from the University of Michigan shows that when scientists worked in a space where they ran into one another - in areas known as “zonal overlap"" - they were more likely to collaborate. The data suggests that creating opportunities for unplanned interactions among employees both inside and outside the organization actually improves performance.

Taking account of the needs of different generations is an important way to make people more comfortable and productive, providing high- quality light in public places and professional spaces. At a time when we are all living and working longer many questions are arising, such as:
What are the things an older employee struggles with the most in relation to lighting?
How can you design office lighting and accommodate different worker age groups?
How can lighting support concentration or creative tasks?
“The one-light-for-all principle is outdated [...] Today 25% of people in work are over 50 years old and office lighting needs a serious rethink at a policy level.”
Flexibility and personalization are considered to be two very important characteristics that can distinguish new solutions suitable for an ageing workforce but also compelling and appetible for younger workers.

As the average age of office workers is increasing, and as even younger people risk becoming sedentary in the way they work, the demand for furniture which supports and encourages more movement and activity is growing.

New work settings should stimulate spontaneous interaction on the one hand and provide the opportunity to sit back and relax or even offer areas where people can work in a focused way without being interrupted.",142,,,
