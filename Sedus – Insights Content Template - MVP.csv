Hacktivism,Techonology,Facts and figures,Hacktivism,Body Copy,"Workplaces are built on human capital. They represent the place in which an organization expresses its common interests, purposes and visions. Where solidarity, reciprocity and resource sharing are embodied for the benefit of everybody.

According to Robert Putnam1, two different kinds of social capital exist. The first is the based on the relationships between homogenous groups, such as members of the same family or tribes and it is known as “bonding social capital”. The second is based on the positive interactions between hetereogeneous groups of people, such as ethnic groups or generations and it is known as “bridging social capital”.

In Putnam’s vision, the traditional organization could always rely on its bonding social capital. It was the glue that held the company together, fostering a sense of belonging and establishing shared values. But the forces of globalisation, demographic upheavals and the digital revolution has limited its influence. An increasingly diverse and disparate workforce has shifted the emphasis towards a greater balance between boding and bridging capital. So, a sense of belonging to a team becomes more important to flexible workers and freelancers while the sense of belonging to the organization depends on conecting teams harmoniously.

Research and experience show us that firms are already team based. They form naturally as teams focusing on sales, manufacturing, retail, product development, service and geographically independent divisions. The challenge is how to coordinate and align these teams, encouraging them to share ideas and information, work together and how we adapt to a new structure that is less focused on upward mobility and more on the development of leadership based on positional power2.

Josh Bersin, founder of Bersin by Deloitte, has underlined the importance of developing the ways in which teams work together and how to create well-balanced human capital as the primary goal of organizational design. This is mainly reflected in the capability of an organization to attract and retain the best talent, to allow them to work in the best possible way and to support them with the most engaging work settings, in terms of space, tools and resources.

“The new organization of today requires us to rethink leadership strategy, focus on culture and engagement, deliver on-demand organizational learning, and provide information centers, analytics, and digital HR tools to help people operate, share information, and work together well”3, he said.

An important aspect of the evolution in the way teams work together, is related to the way workers are included in decision making. The important thing is to avoid top-down impositions and offer the freedom to organise work to better match their work-life balance. Companies which do so have created a better working culture and are more able to adapt to new market conditions4. The interest in flatter organizations, which once was restricted to the tech industries, is rapidly spreading to all other sectors. Attracting new talent is still the strongest motivation for companies to invest in dynamic workplaces. Individuals have the choice to decide where, how and for how long they work. The basis on which they make such choices are diverse and no longer limited to attaining the best salary or career path.choice to decide where, how and how long they work and the drivers upon which they choose are very diverse and not only limited to the best salary or carrier path.

Back in 2006 before the last recession, “The Future of Work” research project from The Workplace Intelligence Unit found that there are at least 10 psychological drivers of workforce productivity which are typically more effective than financial rewards. These drivers - meaning, values, optimism, collaboration, confidence, individualism, autonomy, originality, goals and recognition (see table opposite) - represent the various reasons why employees feel satisfied and engaged in a particular company.

The last ten years have taught us that these factors are not permanent. They change over time as an employee’s needs, expectations and desires change. They also change in line with demographic and cultural changes in the workforce.

This is just as true for freelance and flexible workers as it is for permanent staff. Research shows that the vast majority of organizations (83 percent) consider their part time and contracted staff to be just as productive as full time employees5.

Among the drivers identified, those aspects which support a better work life balance and more flexibility have become increasingly important. This is less a gender based issue with both men and women asking for more time to spend with their families.

As life and work become increasingly integrated, the workers are looking to find new and better ways to balance their professional and personal commitments, asking for better working environments, for more freedom of choice and for the possibility of defining their own professional goals. These dynamics are changing the role of engagement. It is no longer a goal in its own right but a means to create a working experience which positively blurs the lines between private and public life as well as those between individuals, the company and the society.

They are seeking an experience in which their personal fulfillment goes hand in hand with the development of a workplace culture that is respectful of differences in characteristics like age, gender and culture, and that sees the employee not only as a person with skills and competences for the service of the company, but also as an agent of change, a person with healthy links to society and the world outside.

In this scenario, the idea of flexibility is not simply about the capability of the workplace to respond to change, but also the way the company embraces and manages the cultural and wider social changes it should adopt to meet the needs of individuals. “Hierarchical organizational models aren’t just being turned upside down — they’re being deconstructed from the inside out”6.

Technology has a great role to play in this change, but companies mainly need a cultural change: they need to include employees in the process of defining and deciding the company’s goals, allowing them to share their day-to-day experience with the management and participating in the creation of a flatter and flatter organization. Employees need to develop new skills, too.

More freedom at work brings responsibilities and opportunities such as the chance to manage time in a better way or collaborate with other team members to achieve shared goals. By developing such skills, employees gain the power to ""hack"" their working lives to following their personal preferences7, to pursue personal goals, propose new ideas or volunteer in social projects.

Increasingly these projects are welcomed by companies because they represent new forms of civic participation or activism that creates a sense of community within employees. In many cases the companies themselves propose cultural or social programs in which everybody is free to participate. “When individuals feel strongly about a company’s performance on social or environmental issue, one small voice can quickly become a swarm, difficult for even the most shielded executive to ignore”, says Jen Boynton8.

Connecting social issues with the business is a visible sign of a company which embraces democratization, takes care of its employees and bravely face new challenges. “Today our social investments focus on providing access to medicines and building health care capacity for those most in need"", said Caroline Roan, president of the Pfizer Foundation""9.

Making the world a better place” and “doing business” are no more seen as a different goals, as well as putting “the interests and priorities of the employees ahead of customers and shareholders” as millennials are largely entering in the workforce and the old fashion CSR mindset is transformed into “active business citizenship”10.

A paradigm shift based on the belief that higher profits and better products and services are generated by the links between business, community and actively engaged employees. A shift that transforms work from something in which employees do their best, to something in which they be their best.

Hacktivism,Techonology,The expert‘s talk,Efficiency as result of transparency,Bio,"With a degree in Mechanical Engineering, Gianmaurizio Cazzarolli has worked for Tetra Pak since 1982. After a period in the R&D and customer services teams as a manager, today he serves as Director of the Facility and Real Estate Management in the research and production centre of the group in Modena. His team handles all the support operations for the 852 employees, more than 100 of whom come from some 32 countries, in a company that “cares about people, which represent our main investment and our competitive advantage”.",,,
Hacktivism,Techonology,The expert‘s talk,Efficiency as result of transparency,Interview,"Traditionally, efficiency and flexibility are seen as mutually exclusive when managing a workforce; when one increases the other decreases. This does not seem the case with organizations that care about the wellbeing of employees: what are your thoughts about that?

G.C. _ An open organization is one that cares about the welfare of people, offering the necessary flexibility to help them work better and it is often rewarded with a greater willingness from the employee to give more than expected. If a company is transparent and shares with its own employees information and goals, every person is aware of the work process, accepts responsibility and eventually is also available to help colleagues, knowing that next time they will help them back in return.

Therefore, our experience shows that efficiency and flexibility are not exclusive, at all. Empowering people and facilitating their interactions results in the optimization of the working process.

The secret lies in the common sharing of a corporate philosophy, a set of values that everyone must respect. Our mantra is to achieve the goals we have set in a project through the satisfaction and engagement of those who work in it.

Apparently, we are moving from a model of work in which the employees are free to customize their workplace to one in which they have the chance to choose times and places in which to work. Is that the case with Tetra Pak, too? How would this freedom of choice in the way to work impact on the role of management?

G.C. _ Tetra Pak is a family based company, founded in Sweden, a country with a very different working culture compared to those in the Mediterranean. In our offices flexibility has always been at the centre of the relationship between employee and company, at all possible levels.

Allowing flexibility means acknowledging that there are individual aspects - such as who is more efficient in the morning and who in the afternoon - organizational ones - such as those who work with clients in different time zone regions - and work-life balance ones that require a managerial skill to be learned. A skill that we try to teach through dialogue and the development of a particular mindset especially in managers, because it is obvious that if a manager offers greater recognition to someone for staying longer in the office than someone who is more efficient - as often happens in traditional businesses - this would go against the very idea of flexibility. It’s a continuous process that includes opportunities for discussion and support, exchange of experiences and respect for a transparent relationship between the various working levels of the company.

What is the importance of teams in this type of work process? What are the degrees of freedom?

G.C. _ Teams are key elements in the way we work. The employees take responsibility for the work of their own team. Successes and failures are shared and therefore it is in the team that we have to provide the flexibility to assure a good work-life balance.

Tetra Pak has taken the idea of “efficient flexibility” that is typically associated with the new economy and digital sector, and introduced it to a traditional manufacturing industry. What are the peculiarities and difficulties you've encountered in this regard?

G.C. _ First of all, we must specify that the concept of a team in Tetra Pak is not based on departments or functions, but on the set of people who, for various reasons and at different levels, are involved in a project. Therefore it involves people who are working on the project at different stages and in various ways, from the design and construction of machines to the phase of testing of packages or from R&D to commercial.

What are the values that Tetra Pak seeks to develop as the main link between the company and its employees through flexibility at work?

G.C. _ Definitely the main value of this relationship between employees and the company is transparency: there is no real sharing unless you have maximum information flow and knowledge about the challenges and the strategic goals of the company.

Based on that, we can then establish an open dialogue in which everybody can participate and set the modalities through which to achieve our stated goals.

The realisation stage of a project also has to be transparent. In our company the progress of all projects is visible to everybody. We have a so-called ""war room"", a sort of forum at the heart of the production plant, around which all operational areas converge: in this space, some panels report the production chains marked with green, yellow or red depending on whether they're complying with the schedule, they are addressing some problem or they are late.

Simply sharing this information establishes a dialogue between teams, promotes the exchange of experiences and activates forms of collaboration. But transparency is not just about information: all of our offices and facilities are designed for maximum visual transparency and flexibility.

The offices are conceived as smart boxes, made of glass panels, the layout of which can be easily modified in response to specific working requirements. Open space, meeting rooms, separate offices: when we contracted the architects who built our offices, we did not explain to them the way we work. The result was a modular building that allows changes very easily, over a weekend, without modifications to technical plants and still providing maximum transparency among the working spaces.

This is another way to allow people to take responsibility for their behaviours: everyone can see everyone, no hierarchy - of course ensuring confidentiality through the maximum insulation from noise.

Is the company engaged in social projects? How do these projects fit with the company's strategy and how are employees involved? Are they free to combine work and social commitments?

G.C. _ When you ask employees to stay at work overtime or respond to emails outside office hours it means you ask them to combine their professional and private lives. For us, this is acceptable only if allow it to work both ways. Between private interests and work commitments there are a lot of social initiatives that we sometimes promote as a company. We have teams that develop a sense of community amongst employees outside the office, such as those dedicated to artistic or sporting events or charity ones. Many of these projects are related to everyday life. So, we developed a series of public cycle lanes in partnership with the Municipality of Modena to encourage employees to bike to work. Similarly, we contributed to the building of a kindergarten which is open to the children of employees and local citizens. In this way we believe that the collaborative spirit that characterises our way of working can go beyond the gates of our company and become a model for other organizations.",,,
